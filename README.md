# The AppCivist Project 

**AppCivist** is a software platform for democratic assembly and collective action that lets users design and build their own Assemblies, with modular components, to organize democratic action. The project  is a collaboration between the [Social Apps Lab @ CITRIS](http://citris-uc.org/initiatives/social-apps-lab/) at the University of California, Berkeley and [Inria@Silicon Valley](https://project.inria.fr/siliconvalley/). 

## AppCivist Core Platform

This repository contains the source code of the core backend for AppCivist. The core platform provides a RESTful API for managing User authentication, Assembly and Contribution Making. To learn more about these concepts, read the [Project Documentation](#project-documentation) below or go straight to [Getting Started with the AppCivist Core Platform](docs/getting-started.md) to download the source code, install the platform and run it.   

### Other project source code repositories 
* [AppCivist-PB prototype UI](https://github.com/socialappslab/appcivist-pb-client): main prototype User Interface of the AppCivist Project for Participatory Budgeting.
* [AppCivist Voting API](https://github.com/socialappslab/appcivist-voting-api): AppCivist Prototype implementation of a Ballot Based Voting API that allows both registered and non-registered users to cast votes on AppCivist users contributions. 

Altogether, the **AppCivist-PB prototype UI** connected to both the **AppCivist Core Platform** and the **AppCivist Voting API** form the alpha prototype of the AppCivist project.
